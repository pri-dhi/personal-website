      <h2>Engineering Design</h2>
      <p class="dark">In this project, my group and I designed a baby onesie that would prevent children who live in countries where child death rates are high from succumbing to SIDS.</p>
      <img src="engineer.jpg" alt="A rough sketch of a child's onesie with features including two gyroscopes, an LED screen, a heart rate monitor, a temperature checker, a battery pack, a pulse oximeter, and a Bluetooth transciever." width="400">

      <h2>Fashion Design and Technology</h2>
      <p class="dark">In this project, my group and I designed three garments to be worn by individuals in the workforce to optimize their workwear and provide greater safety and efficiency in their work.</p>
      <img src="fashion.jpg" alt="Three multiview sketches of a corset with a vibration and heating pad powered by a motor located on the back, two sketches of a helmet with various features to ensure safety and easy communication of the wearer, a sketch of a full-body undergarment suit lined with thin pipes, a sketch of a firefighter suit, and a sketch of a PLSS container.">

      <h2>Manufacturing a Snack Container</h2>
      <p class="dark">In this project, I followed the engineer design process from brainstorming, sketching, modeling, to prototyping my final optimized design of a chip container that was accessible for all users and easy to dispense chips from.</p>
      <img src="chip.jpg" alt="Digital models of a lid, inner container, bottom piece, fastener, slider door, and Dorito chip. One assembly view showing all parts separately and one view where all parts are assembled and in place.">

      <h2>Manufacturing a Keychain</h2>
      <p class="dark">In this project, I designed a keychain that is comfortable to hold and to wear, has a tool contained in the design, and follows the constraints and requirements as assigned in the problem statement.</p>
      <img src="bear.jpg" alt="Digital model of a keychain shaped as a bear dangling by the arm. In the center there is a circle with a logo that depicts the initials PD shaped as a heart.">

      <h2>Basic Programming</h2>
      <p class="dark">Here is a basic interactive programming assignment I worked on at school.
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/pdhingra/full/lmgJaUsK8" alt="An alien is bouncing around the screen on a red planet in space with twinkling stars and a moon in the background. Every time the alien hits a wall of the screen, it changes color and the size of its eyes at random values. When the green button, labeled Moon, in the bottom left corner is pressed, the moon in the background moves across the screen.">Conditional Creature Project</a></p>

      <h2 id="pad">Prosthetic Robot Hand</h2>
      <p class="dark">Here is a video in which I teach how to construct a prosthetic robot hand using household items for an organization that works to bring STEM education to girls.</p>
